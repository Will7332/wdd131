                <p>Here is my first cartographic temple map! As a student at BYU-Idaho, I have been inspired to
                    illustrate the local temples
                    and the geography of the state, starting out with the Rexburg temple, followed by the Idaho Falls
                    temple. After completing
                    the current temples in operation, I decided to include future temples for anyone interested. I used
                    the renders released by the
                    church to create these illustrations based off of them in their respective locations.</p>

                <p> My second cartographic temple map, I decided to do my home state of Florida. I have grown up going
                    to the Orlando temple, the only temple in Florida for a long time.
                    While it was only a half hour drive for me, seeing the growth of the church in my state the past
                    decade leading to now 5 total temples being either announced or constructed has brought
                    me joy, leading to the inspiration of creating this map.</p>

                    Having served my mission in Colorado, I knew I had to make a temples map of this state.
                    I served in the Colorado Springs mission, where the nearest temple was Denver. However The CO
                    Springs temple was recently announced in October 2023 and will be the 4th temple to be built in the
                    state.

                    Growing up I have taken many road trips along the East Coast, and have explored many places in the
                    Northeastern part of the country. This map displays the unique array of temples in this region,
                    which are particularly based off of the colonial roots of the US.

                    There have been significant church events that have occured within this region, in particular with
                    Ohio and Illinois.
                    I have also had the privilege of visiting church sites in these areas, including Nauvoo and western
                    Missouri.

                    I visited California for the first time in summer of 2023. Southern California has a very beautiful
                    geography and landscape. There is a large LDS population in this area, causing the need for 5
                    temples that are currently built or under construction in the region alone.

                    I have personal family roots from this region, which led to the inspiration of creating the Mexico
                    City temple where my parents got sealed, and the new Puebla temple which is where my mother's family
                    is from. Recenty President Nelson has announced 5 more temples to be built in the Mexico City
                    vicinity, which include Pachuca, Tula, Toluca, Cuernavaca and Benemerito.

                    I first created a map solely for temples in Southern California because there were enough to fit in
                    one map.
                    After creating that map I thought to myself I might as well do the rest of California. The state has
                    a total of 12 temples either dedicated, constructed or announced.
