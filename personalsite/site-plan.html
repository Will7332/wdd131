        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This is a portfolio showcasing my hobby of creating maps displaying LDS temples in a creative way.
        I aim to share that with everyone to give viewers a unique perspective of temple locations and their designs.</p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Anyone interested in learning more about the geography and design of LDS temple in different regions.</p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
        <p>For the Explore Maps page, I am planning on creating an object of map images, with each item containing each map, with attributes including the name, image, description region, and possibly tags. I will also have a modal pop up of the image the user clicks for a zoomed in view. The user can close the modal. On the home page, I also might add a search feature for users to search a keyword and maps appear. If time allows, I will also have a random map generate at the bottom of my home page.

        <p>Welcome to my LDS Temple Map Portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of digital, illustrationed 3D maps of LDS Temples
        in different areas. Each map is a unique blend of creativity and devotion, capturing the beauty and significance of these sacred places in a fun
        and artistic way. Whether you're a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or simply appreciate the
        architecture and geography of these temples, I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
        For each map, I start by selecting a region to focus on and the temples I want to feature. I then explore the general
        architecture and geography of each temple to understand how best to represent them in a unique way. The creation process begins in ArcGIS Pro, where I design a cartographic 3D map of the region. I then import a photo of this map as a layer into Adobe Illustrator.
        Using this as a guide,
        I carefully illustrate the temples on top of the map layer, adding detailed touches to enhance the overall aesthetic. I
        have decided to also create maps that include the future sites of temples if their renderings are available. After some finishing touches of the map such as labels and styling, it leaves with the final result, a one-of-a-kind artistic map that combines accuracy with creativity, highlighting the beauty and uniqueness of each temple.
        Here is a list of the maps I have made so far. Go to my maps page to explore the maps I have made!

        <p>Idaho Temples Map
        Here is my first cartographic temple map! As a student at BYU-Idaho, I have been inspired to illustrate the local
        temples
        and the geography of the state, starting out with the Rexburg temple, followed by the Idaho Falls temple. After
        completing
        the current temples in operation, I decided to include future temples for anyone interested. I used the renders released
        by the
        church to create these illustrations based off of them in their respective locations.
        
        Florida Temples Map
        My second cartographic temple map, I decided to do my home state of Florida. I have grown up going to the Orlando
        temple, the only temple in Florida for a long time.
        While it was only a half hour drive for me, seeing the growth of the church in my state the past decade leading to now 5
        total temples being either announced or constructed has brought
        me joy, leading to the inspiration of creating this map.
        
        Colorado Temples Map
        Having served my mission in Colorado, I knew I had to make a temples map of this state. I served in the Colorado Springs
        mission, where the
        nearest temple was Denver. However The CO Springs temple was recently announced and will be the 4th temple to be built
        in the state.
        
        Northeast Temples Map
        Growing up I have taken many road trips along the East Coast, and have explored many places in the Northeastern part of
        the country. This map displays
        the unique array of temples in this region, particularly based off of the colonial roots of the US.
        
        Midwest Temples Map
        There have been significant church events that have occured within this region, in particular with Ohio and Illinois. I
        have also had the privelage
        of visiting church sites in this region, including in Nauvoo and western Missouri.
        
        California Temples Map
        I first created a map solely for temples in Southern California because there were enough to fit in one map. After
        creating that map I thought to myself
        I might as well the rest of California. The state has a total of 12 temples either dedicated, constructed or announced.
        
        Central Mexico Map
        I have personal family roots from this region, which led to the inspiration of creating the Mexico City temple where my
        parents got sealed,
        and the new Puebla temple which is where my mother's family is from. Recenty President Nelson has announced 5 more
        temples to be built in the Mexico City vicinity,
        which include Pachuca, Tula, Toluca, Cuernavaca and Benemerito.
